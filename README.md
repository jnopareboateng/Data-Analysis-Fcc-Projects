## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to the Data Analysis with Python Certification projects on freeCodeCamp. The projects demonstrate a good foundational knowledge of data analysis with Python.

## How to Replicate
1. **Prerequisites**: You need to have Python installed on your system. The projects use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
2. **Installation**: Clone this repository to your local system and navigate to the project directory.
3. **Running the tests**: Each project has its own standalone Python script. You can run them individually to see the output.
4. **Deployment**: These projects are not meant for deployment. They are for educational purposes to demonstrate data analysis with Python.

## Usage
(Provide examples and code snippets on how to use your project or software)

## Challenges Faced
The main challenges faced during these projects were understanding the data, cleaning it, and choosing the right visualization techniques. Overcoming these challenges required a deep understanding of the Python libraries used and the data itself.

## Collaboration
Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome. Feel free to check the [issues page] if you want to contribute.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to Landon Schlangen and his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@landonschlangen). He provides many videos on the freeCodeCamp certification projects. I strongly endorse him.
